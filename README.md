## Development Log
#### Day 1
  * Initialized project folder on github.
  * Wrote Thing class, which is framework that all other classes will follow.
  * Realized that I need a Displayable interface.

#### Day 2
  * Worked on the Food class.
  * Realized that it'd be easier to just put the color and consumed variables in the Thing class.
  * Revised the Thing constructor to include the color variables.
  * Got Food class written and displayed properly.

#### Day 3
  * Worked on SnakePart class.
  * Realized that I need a Moveable interface.

#### Day 4
  * Started working on Snake class.
  * Realized I needed to access each SnakePart's x and y. Added getX() and getY() to SnakePart class.
  * Changed each SnakePart from circle to ellipse 'cause it looks more snake-like.
  * Worked on moving the Snake. Couldn't get it to work quite right.

#### Day 5
  * Worked on getting Snake to display properly.
  * A new ellipse was displayed every time I moved my mouse, so it didn't exactly work as intended.

#### Day 6
  * Decided to scrap the whole mouseX mouseY thing and go back to the basics.
  * Started with just one circle. I found a very helpful post on how to get a shape to follow the mouse and was
    finally able to get the Snake to move at least somewhat properly.

#### Day 7
  * Started to program the movement of the entire Snake, not just one part of it.
  * I don't uh, really know how to describe what was happening but it just wasn't working correctly.
    It *kinda* moved like a snake but definitely not how it was supposed to.
  * I also started programming the food being eaten (i.e. Snake touching Food), but couldn't get it working right.

#### Day 8
