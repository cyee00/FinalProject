## Development Log
### Day 1
  * Initialized project folder on github.
  * Wrote Thing class, which is framework that all other classes will follow.
  * Realized that I need a Displayable interface.

### Day 2
  * Started working on the Food class.
  * Realized that it'd be easier to just put the color variables in the Thing class. Revised the Thing constructor.
  * Got Food class written and displayed properly.
