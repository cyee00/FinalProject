## Development Log
#### &#x1F538; Day 1
  * Initialized project folder on github.
  * Wrote Thing class, which is framework that all other classes will follow.
  * Realized that I need a Displayable interface.

#### &#x1F538; Day 2
  * Worked on the Food class.
  * Realized that it'd be easier to just put the color and consumed variables in the Thing class.
  * Revised the Thing constructor to include the color variables.
  * Got Food class written and displayed properly.

#### &#x1F538; Day 3
  * Worked on SnakePart class.
  * Realized that I need a Moveable interface.

#### &#x1F538; Day 4
  * Started working on Snake class.
  * Realized I needed to access each SnakePart's x and y. Added getX() and getY() to SnakePart class.
  * Changed each SnakePart from circle to ellipse 'cause it looks more snake-like.
  * Worked on moving the Snake. Couldn't get it to work quite right.

#### &#x1F538; Day 5
